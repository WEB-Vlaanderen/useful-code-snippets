# Useful debugging tips

You've probably used console.log plenty of times. Itâ€™s the way to go when it comes to debugging for many web developers. But did you know that there are a lot more helpful functions available?

```javascript
console.count(); // prints the number of times this function is called
console.count();
console.count();
```

Output
```
default: 1
default: 2
default: 3
```

Even more useful is to pass a label to the function

```javascript
console.count("Name"); // prints the number of times the count function is called with label "Name"
console.count("Hello");
console.count("Name");
```

Output
```
Name: 1
Hello: 1
Name: 2
```
